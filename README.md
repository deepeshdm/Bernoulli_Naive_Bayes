# Rules to use this algorithm 
1] Label class column should be at the last of your dataset
2] There should be no missing values.

The Titanic Dataset used in the above code has been modified. Certain columns have been removed while certain values have been changed , all of this is done within the code.
The main algorithm contains only 2 fucntions which it uses to calculate the probabilities.

The implementation is based on Bayes Formula even though the code doesnt show direct implementation of the formula.
